	<h2 id="intro">Intro:</h2>		
		<strong>Photography</strong> is the science, art and practice of creating durable images by recording light 
or other electromagnetic radiation, either chemically by means of a light-sensitive material 
such as photographic film, or electronically by means of an image sensor. Typically, a lens 
is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive 
surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. 
	<p>		
With an electronic image sensor, this produces an 
electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file 
for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, 
which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the 
purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally 
used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger
 or by contact printing.</p>


	<h2 id="interlude">Black and White</h2>
		According to Wikipedia:
		<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography#Black-and-white">
		All photography was originally monochrome, or black-and-white. </blockquote>Even after color 
		film was readily available, black-and-white photography continued to dominate for decades, 
		due to its lower cost and its "classic" photographic look. The tones and contrast between light 
		and dark areas define black-and-white photography. It is important to note that monochromatic 
		pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades of gray, 
		but can involve shades of one particular hue depending on the process. The cyanotype process, 
		for example, produces an image composed of blue tones. The albumen print process, first used more
		 than 150 years ago, produces brownish tones.

	Many photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, sometimes because of the established 
	archival permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images 
	are processed using a variety of techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers 
	produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display 
	can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original 
	form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective.
